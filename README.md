# Project for Bayesian Statistics: Techniques and Tools 

This fantastic course was taught by Matthew Heiner, doctoral student at UC Santa Cruz.

In this final project, we carry out statistical analysis on the Titanic Disaster dataset to find out what factors influenced the survival of a passenger and to what extent. We use Bayesian Logistic Regression and a Hierarchical variant (random intercept model) for the analysis.


The R code is in the `src` folder and the final report is in the `Bayesian Statistics Final Report.pdf` file.
